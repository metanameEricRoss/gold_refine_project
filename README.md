# Gold Refinement Analysis

## Introduction 
The goal of this project is to build a prediction model that will predict the output of gold yeild, with the lowest chance of error

## Data Preprocessing
We had 3 datasets, Train, Test and Full there were a few outlier values presumed to be sensor faults or measuring device failure. 

## EDA
Where are we losing the most gold from the solution and, what does the whole batch look like at each stage of refinement?

## Model Evaluation
I applied various Linear Regressiom based Models, Random Forest Model, and SVM to compare for training and testing. 

## Model Testing 
X model was selected due to y metric, which outpreformed all other model in having the lowest margin of error based on y metric. 

## Conclusion
